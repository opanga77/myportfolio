## Discussion and analysis
This project gives you the basic knowledge on the mark-up
language (HTML, CSS , JavaScript) to develop a static as well as dynamic website for
personal use, commercial use or for the business purpose and for the
students who are willing to learn the mark-up language as well.

Mark-up language are easy to use where the people can write the code even in
notepad. There are some others software to write the mark-up language for example
sublime text, dream weaver, notepad++, gedit text editors for Linux etc. But, I was used sublime text editors for doing this project.

In this project different types of css has been used to make the pages more attractive whereas JavaScript is used to make the page dynamic.

Sublime text is used to code the mark up language. The sublime text is very easy and convenient to use. It is supported on Mac, Linux and windows so it provides chance for the cross platform therefore sublime was choose to complete the project. The first page of the website is the home page where a massage for the visitors and my short profile is displayed. Also, date and time is considered to be in the home page. It also contains my picture so as to give a good impression to the visitors. Another page of the website is the portfolio section where everything about me is mentioned in detail. My work experience, skills, objectives, awards and achievements, interest and personal information is mentioned. Additionally, if anybody wants to contact me or hire me there is an easy option of reaching upto me. This page describes me in every aspect.

Similarly, the third page of the website is the blog section. The blog is all about how technology has taken over the recent decades and is very helpful in our daily life. It also contains how our daily life has been affected by the use of technology. The advantage of the technology is described in detail. Again there is the connect me option so that people can reach me in case they want. Likewise, the other page is the gallery section which was not not required in the question but to give a website a professional look the gallery section contains my achievements in major fields. Another section is the research section where I have included the links of the websites from where I have taken the major concepts of making websites and style sheets. The links are listed and as we click the link the link expand to give a screen-shot of the original web page. The last section is the contact section and there are two forms. One of the form is the hire form where people can fill form with their details and message. Another form is the feedback form where suggestion, feedback and complain can be given according to peopleâ€™s interest. So that was all about the website.
